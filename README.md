# About
Anarchy-Core is an open source Discord API wrapper that targets .NET 6.0.

It has REST, Gateway and media (although livestreaming functionality is limited) support, including user-only functions, making it the most capable wrapper by a long shot.

Full source code can be found on [github](https://github.com/andreas-henning/Anarchy).
